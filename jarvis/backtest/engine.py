# jarvis/backtest/engine.py
# Version: 1.0.0
# External deterministic backtest layer.
# External to jarvis/core/, jarvis/risk/, jarvis/portfolio/,
# jarvis/execution/, jarvis/orchestrator/ per FAS v6.1.0 architecture rules.
#
# DETERMINISM GUARANTEE:
#   No stochastic operations. No random number generation. No sampling.
#   No external state reads. No side effects. No file I/O. No logging.
#   No environment variable access. No global mutable state.
#   Output is a pure function of inputs.
#
# PURPOSE:
#   Rolls a sliding window over returns_series and asset_price_series,
#   delegating all risk and allocation logic to run_full_pipeline() at
#   each timestep. No risk or allocation logic is reimplemented here.
#
# DESIGN NOTE -- SYMBOL KEY:
#   run_full_pipeline() requires asset_prices: dict[str, float].
#   run_backtest() receives a scalar price series with no symbol names.
#   A fixed synthetic key "ASSET" is used to wrap each scalar price into
#   the required single-entry dict at every timestep. This is the only
#   valid deterministic approach that avoids reimplementing downstream
#   logic.
#
# EQUITY UPDATE CONTRACT:
#   equity[t] = equity[t-1] * (1.0 + returns_series[t] * position_size)
#   where position_size is the scalar extracted from the single-key
#   positions dict returned by run_full_pipeline().
#
# Standard import pattern:
#   from jarvis.backtest.engine import run_backtest

    Deterministic rolling-window backtest over a single-asset return series.

    For each timestep t >= window:
      1. Slices returns_series[t - window : t] as the lookback window.
      2. Wraps asset_price_series[t] into a single-entry dict under the
         synthetic key "ASSET".
      3. Calls run_full_pipeline() to obtain position size.
      4. Extracts the scalar position size from the returned dict.
      5. Updates equity: equity * (1.0 + returns_series[t] * position_size).
      6. Appends updated equity to the equity curve.

    All risk assessment and allocation logic is delegated to
    run_full_pipeline(). Nothing is reimplemented here.

    Parameters
    ----------
    returns_series : list[float]
        Sequence of per-period returns. Must have length >= window.
        Passed as the lookback window to run_full_pipeline() at each step.
        No NaN or Inf values permitted (validated downstream by RiskEngine).
    window : int
        Lookback window size in periods. Must be >= 20 (RiskEngine minimum).
    initial_capital : float
        Starting equity value. Must be strictly positive.
        Passed as total_capital to run_full_pipeline() at each step.
    asset_price_series : list[float]
        Per-period asset prices. Must have the same length as returns_series.
        Each scalar price is wrapped into a single-entry dict at each step.
        All prices must be strictly positive (validated downstream).
    regime : GlobalRegimeState
        Canonical GlobalRegimeState instance from jarvis.core.regime.
        Passed unchanged to run_full_pipeline() at every timestep.
    meta_uncertainty : float
        Meta-uncertainty in [0.0, 1.0].
        Passed unchanged to run_full_pipeline() at every timestep.
    slippage_model : Optional[SlippageModel]
        When provided, slippage is computed via StrategyLab.compute_slippage()
        and subtracted from the equity update at each timestep:
        equity * (1.0 + return * position_size - slippage).
        When None (default), no slippage is applied (backward compatible).

    Returns
    -------
    list[float]
        Equity curve. One entry per timestep t where t >= window.
        Length is len(returns_series) - window.
        Returns an empty list if len(returns_series) == window
        (no full step available beyond the first window).

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If window < 20.
        If initial_capital <= 0.
        If len(asset_price_series) != len(returns_series).
        Additional ValueError may propagate from run_full_pipeline()
        on invalid returns or price values.

    Notes
    -----
    Deterministic. No side effects. No global state. Pure function.
    regime and meta_uncertainty are held constant across all timesteps.
    This matches the function signature contract. Dynamic regime
    sequencing is out of scope for this module.
